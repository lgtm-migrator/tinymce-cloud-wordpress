# TinyMCE PowerPaste (via Cloud) for WordPress

#### NOTE: For installation details please read installation-steps.md

This plugin allows you to run the TinyMCE PowerPaste plugin (from the TinyMCE Cloud offering) within WordPress (4.5+).
  
The plugin assumes you have a TinyMCE Cloud API Key and will provide that upon installing the plugin.  No TinyMCE plugins are included as a part of this package.

This plugin has been tested against the following WordPress versions:


* **WordPress 4.5.x** *(with TinyMCE 4.3.x)*
* **WordPress 4.6.x** *(wth TinyMCE 4.4.x)*
  

**Note:** *There is a Gulp task designed to create the ZIP that someone would
need to deploy this plugin to a WP server - see `Create ZIP for Distribution`.
There are other tasks used to push code to local WP instances during testing
that would have no real use to people wanting to deploy this solution.*
