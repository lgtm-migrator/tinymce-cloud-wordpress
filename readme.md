#### NOTE: For installation details please read installation-steps.md

This plugin allows you to run the TinyMCE Enterprise PowerPaste plugin within
WordPress (4.5+).  This plugin has been tested against the following WordPress versions:


**WordPress 4.5.x / TinyMCE 4.3.x**
 * PowerPaste
 * Spellchecking
 * @Mentions
 * Accessibility Checker
 
**WordPress 4.6.x / TinyMCE 4.4.x**
  * PowerPaste

**Note:** *There is a Gulp task designed to create the ZIP that someone would
need to deploy this plugin to a WP server - see `Create ZIP for Distribution`.
There are other tasks used to push code to local WP instances during testing
that would have no real use to people wanting to deploy this solution.*
