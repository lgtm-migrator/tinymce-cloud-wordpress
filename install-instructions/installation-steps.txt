Installing TinyMCE PowerPaste
=============================
The TinyMCE PowerPaste plugin is provided as a ZIP file named `powerpaste-wordpress.zip`.
You install this plugin (`powerpaste-wordpress.zip`) as you would install any other WordPress
plugin.  Guidance for installing WordPress plugins may be found on https://wordpress.org/.

A Note on File Permissions
==========================
In some operating systems you may find that the file permissions on the TinyMCE PowerPaste plugin
folder (and/or files) won't allow WordPress to read the files.  This will manifest itself as the
plugin not showing in the admin screen.  If you see this issue make sure that "Everyone" can read
the`powerpaste-wordpress` folder and all of its child files/folders.

Enabling the TinyMCE PowerPaste plugin
======================================
By default PowerPaste is enabled when you install and activate the TinyMCE PowerPaste plugin.
You can modify the default settings of the plugin by visiting the TinyMCE PowerPaste plugin
settings page in the WordPress Admin page.

In the Settings area of the Admin page (`http://<your_wordpress_instance>/wp-admin/options-general.php`)
you should now see a link for TinyMCE PowerPaste.  Clicking this will take you to the settings for
TinyMCE PowerPaste.


Confirm permissions on `wp-content/uploads` folder
==================================================
The user (on your server) that runs all of the PHP scripts in this plugin needs write access to the
`wp-content` folder for this plugin to function properly.

If you use PowerPaste to paste images into TinyMCE (enabled by default) you need to make sure that this
plugin can write files to the `wp-content/uploads` folder (and all of its child folders).  This is
necessary to allow PowerPaste to upload and store images that are pasted into TinyMCE from MS Word and
MS Excel.  The same permissions are used by the WordPress Media Library code to allow it to upload and
store images.

When pasting MS Word content if the content contains an image, that image should result in an `<img>`
tag with a URL pointing to a file within the `wp-content/uploads` folder.  For example:

<img src="http://localhost/~mfromin/wordpress452/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blobid0-1465660986-8468.png" width="212" height="53" />

If you instead see a `Base64` or `Blob` encoded image in the HTML source look in your PHP error log.
If the PHP error log states something like this:


     PHP Warning:  move_uploaded_file(): Unable to move '/private/var/tmp/phpf6d4n9'
     to '<path_to_wordpress_install>/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blobid0-1465592547-775.png'
     in <path_to_wordpress_install>/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/tinymce-enterprise/imageHandler.php


...then you have a permissions issue.  This error implies that this plugin's image upload script
(`imageHandler.php`) cannot write to the `uploads` folder or one of its child folders.

You can resolve this error by doing one or both of the following:

* Ensure that the owner or the `imageHandler.php` script is the same as the core WordPress PHP files.
  If your WordPress install is working then the PHP files of the core WordPress system are properly setup.
  Mirroring those settings with `chmod`/`chown` or similar should address the permissions of the PHP script.

* Modify the settings for the `wp-content` folder (and its child folders) so that the user that runs the
  `imageHandler.php` script has write access to this folder.

Recommended Browsers and the “Local Host Image” dialog box
==========================================================
The recommended browsers for TinyMCE PowerPaste for WordPress are Chrome v54+, Firefox v45+ and Internet Explorer v11.

Users with older versions of Chrome, Firefox and IE, as well as all Safari and Edge users, can still install and use the plugin.

Users with non-recommended browsers may see an additional "Local Host Image" dialog prompting for an image paste when attempting to copy and paste content that contains images.

Please note that this dialog requiring a second paste action is not an error, but a necessary additional step due to the way some browsers handle the copy and pasting of images.

To no longer see the “Local Host Image” dialog:

— Chrome, Firefox or IE users should upgrade their browser to meet the minimum version noted above.
— Safari and Edge users will need to switch to a recommended version of Chrome, Firefox or IE.

Ephox is continuing to work with the relevant browser vendors to improve copy and paste handling for images.
