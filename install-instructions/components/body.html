<h1 id="installing-tinymce-powerpaste">Installing TinyMCE PowerPaste</h1>
<p>The TinyMCE PowerPaste plugin is provided as a ZIP file named <code>powerpaste-wordpress.zip</code>.
You install this plugin (<code>powerpaste-wordpress.zip</code>) as you would install any other WordPress
plugin.  Guidance for installing WordPress plugins may be found on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">https://wordpress.org/</a>.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-file-permissions">A Note on File Permissions</h3>
<p>In some operating systems you may find that the file permissions on the TinyMCE PowerPaste plugin
folder (and/or files) won&#39;t allow WordPress to read the files.  This will manifest itself as the plugin not showing
in the admin screen.  If you see this issue make sure that &quot;Everyone&quot; can read the<code>powerpaste-wordpress</code> folder and
all of its child files/folders.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-the-tinymce-powerpaste-plugin">Enabling the TinyMCE PowerPaste plugin</h2>
<p>By default PowerPaste is enabled when you install and activate the TinyMCE PowerPaste plugin.
You can modify the default settings of the plugin by visiting the TinyMCE PowerPaste plugin
settings page in the WordPress Admin page.</p>
<p>In the Settings area of the Admin page (<code>http://&lt;your_wordpress_instance&gt;/wp-admin/options-general.php</code>)
you should now see a link for TinyMCE PowerPaste.  Clicking this will take you to the settings for
TinyMCE PowerPaste.</p>
<h2 id="confirm-permissions-on-wp-content-uploads-folder">Confirm permissions on <code>wp-content/uploads</code> folder</h2>
<p><strong><em>The user (on your server) that runs all of the PHP scripts in this plugin needs write access to the <code>wp-content</code>
folder for this plugin to function properly.</em></strong></p>
<p>If you use PowerPaste to paste images into TinyMCE (enabled by default) you need to make sure that this plugin
can write files to the <code>wp-content/uploads</code> folder (and all of its child folders).  This is necessary to allow
PowerPaste to upload and store images that are pasted into TinyMCE from MS Word and MS Excel.  The same permissions
are used by the WordPress Media Library code to allow it to upload and store images.</p>
<p>When pasting MS Word content if the content contains an image, that image should result in an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag with
a URL pointing to a file within the <code>wp-content/uploads</code> folder.  For example:</p>
<p><code>&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost/~mfromin/wordpress452/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blobid0-1465660986-8468.png&quot; width=&quot;212&quot; height=&quot;53&quot; /&gt;</code></p>
<p>If you instead see a <code>Base64</code> or <code>Blob</code> encoded image in the HTML source look in your PHP error log.  If the PHP error log
states something like this:</p>
<pre><code>PHP Warning:  move_uploaded_file(): Unable to move &#39;/private/var/tmp/phpf6d4n9&#39;
to &#39;&lt;path_to_wordpress_install&gt;/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blobid0-1465592547-775.png&#39;
in &lt;path_to_wordpress_install&gt;/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/tinymce-enterprise/imageHandler.php
</code></pre><p>...then you have a permissions issue.  This error implies that this plugin&#39;s image upload script (<code>imageHandler.php</code>) cannot write to the <code>uploads</code> folder or one of its child folders.</p>
<p>You can resolve this error by doing one or both of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the owner or the <code>imageHandler.php</code> script is the same as the core WordPress PHP files.  If your WordPress install is working then the PHP files of the core WordPress system are properly setup.  Mirroring those settings with <code>chmod</code>/<code>chown</code> or similar should address the permissions of the  PHP script. </li>
<li>Modify the settings for the <code>wp-content</code> folder (and its child folders) so that the user that runs the <code>imageHandler.php</code> script has write access to this folder. </li>
</ul>
