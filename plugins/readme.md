This is the directory where you place each of the TinyMCE Enterprise
plugins.

For example:

```
plugins/
   powerpaste
   a11ychecker
```

You only need to add the plugins that you want to run into this `plugins`
folder.  This plugin is smart enough to not show options (or load plugins) 
for those that don't exist in that directory.
